# The Walmart Challenge: Modelling future 28 days' sales

## Objective
The Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy) provides data from Walmart stores across the US in a couple of given states (CA, TX, WI), and the main objective is to estimatE/predict the unit sales of Walmart retail goods at these locations for the next 28 days. 

## Approach
The original code was posted on https://www.kaggle.com/ragnar123/very-fst-model/notebook and it was one of the top performers of the M5 Forecasting competition. I further improved the code by clustering the data based on their sales variancesï¼Œjust so items with similar seasonal trends will be clustered into the same groups, and thereby higher accuracy was received.
